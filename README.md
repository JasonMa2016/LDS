# Likelihood-Based Diverse Sampling for Trajectory Forecasting

This is the official repository for ICCV 2021 paper [Likelihood-Based Diverse Sampling for Trajectory Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06106). 
LDS is a simple training objective to diversify the predictions of a pre-trained Normalizing Flow or VAE-based forecasting models. In this repository,
we provide a lightweight example implementing LDS on a toy forecasting task (similar to Figure 1 in the paper). To implement LDS on your own data/task,
